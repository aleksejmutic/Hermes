# Hermes (Shipping Information System)

Hermes is a desktop information system designed for managing shipments, clients, and logistics operations, developed in **Java Swing** with an **MSSQL** backend. The application allows users to manage shipping records, track parcels, and organize operations efficiently. This project was developed as part of the **Design of Information Systems** course during the 4th year at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in East Sarajevo.

# What I learned

During the development of Hermes, I gained practical experience in the structured design and implementation of information systems. The project reinforced the importance of modeling first â€” using **UML diagrams** to plan entities, relationships, and workflows before writing any code. Additionally, I explored **software design principles** and **documentation techniques** using RUP templates, which helped me understand how to create maintainable, scalable, and well-documented systems.

# How Hermes was made

The project began with careful documentation using **RUP templates**, followed by UML modeling in **SAP PowerDesigner** to create class, use case, and sequence diagrams, after which followed database modelling. Once the models were validated, the implementation started using **Java Swing** for the GUI and **MSSQL** for persistent data storage.
